				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p> Hello, I'm Diana. I am training to become a full-stack web developer. I started training with iO in August 2021. By the end I will have a diverse set of skills, ranging from desgin to HTML, CSS, Javascript all the way to PHP.</p>
				<p>I was first introduced to the world of coding on a little island in Malaysia. From there I dipped my toes in the waters of coding, which has landed me to where I am today.
